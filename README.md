This project focuses on data creation and analysis, specifically the analysis of regression models using the books_corpus.csv file.

The Jupyter Notebook file is the core of the project. It contains all the necessary code to run the project. Make sure that all cells in this notebook are executed.

The dataset books_corpus was created specifically for this project.

Data Analysis:
The project.ipynb file begins with a thorough data analysis of the books_corpus.csv dataset. Exploratory Data Analysis is performed to gain insights into the distribution, patterns, and characteristics of the data. This section is crucial for understanding the dataset and making informed decisions during preprocessing and modeling.

Data Preprocessing:
The data preprocessing section in the notebook details the steps taken to clean and prepare the dataset for modeling. It includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. The notebook provides a clear overview of how the data was transformed to make it suitable for machine learning.

It also shows the strategy used to split the data into training and testing sets. Additionally, it highlights the variables selected for the modeling process.

Lazy Prediction:
Lazy prediction was used to quickly evaluate the performance of multiple regression models.

Model Evaluation:
The evaluation of specific regression models is done. Metrics such as MAE and MSE are presented for each model.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
PCA is explored as a means to enhance model performance.
